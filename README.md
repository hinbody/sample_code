The file sampleCode.cpp contains 1)a class that I wrote for my programming class
that defines a specialized type of float variable; 2)several functions that:
build a linked list from standard input, add a single node to that list, delete
a single node from that list, read a file for input to build a list with, sort
the list in ascending order, and delete all items in the list except a dummy
head node.

The file shop.php is code that I wrote which pulls a list of items from a
MySQL database and displays the items plus an image of the item in a table

Finally, players.php is some code I wrote for an app that provides a form to
enter the name, team, and position of a player on a sports team. Once the
information is entered and successfully stored in the database, the user is
shown a list of all the players entered so far. This can be seen in action at
